## Variables
There are 4 types of variables:
```JavaScript

x = 1;
const y = 1;
var z = 1;
let a = 1;
```
### const

A constant variable can be used as `const var = yournumber`
A constant variable cannot be redefined

### var

A "var" is a variable with a scope and is used as `var var = yournumber`
A var can only used in its scope

### let
let is basically a var but doesn't have a scope and can be used everywhere
`let var = 56`
